                <h2>Our Cartificate & Online Program For 2024</h2>
                <p>Dhaka University of Engineering & Technology (DUET), Gazipur was founded as the College of Engineering, Dhaka with the motto “Technology is the
                    Advancement” at its temporary campus at Tejgaon, Dhaka, Bangladesh in 1980. It was then renamed as Dhaka Engineering College (DEC) under the 
                    University of Dhaka in 1981, and used to offer Bachelor of Engineering programs in Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical disciplines. With the 
                    passage of time, Dhaka Engineering College was empowered autonomy under the Bangladesh Institute of Technology ordinance no. XXI of 1986, 
                    under the name Bangladesh Institute of Technology, Dhaka (Abbreviated as BITD) to award undergraduate and postgraduate degrees. Hence 
                    September 1, 2003 became a historic day when the institute became an autonomous statutory organization of Government of the People’s 
                    Republic of Bangladesh under the Dhaka University of Engineering and Technology, Gazipur Act 2003.

        <h1>What Is Computer Science?</h1>
        <p class="p">Computer science is the study of computer hardware and software. Those who study computer science, consequently, can specialize in a wide range of interrelated subfields, from artificial intelligence and cryptography to computer engineering and software development.</p>
        <p class="p">Computer science careers can be found in various industries and organizations, including computer software companies, game development studios, financial services, and even the government. They also work in research and for social media companies and manufacturers, to name a few.  In this article, you'll learn more about the field of computer science, how it's used in industries across the world, and the jobs you might qualify for with a background in computer science. Read on to learn more.</p>
        <h2 class="h2">Computer science meaning</h2>
        <p class="p">Computer science is an interdisciplinary field focused on studying computers and their uses in the real world. As a result, the field of computer science focuses as much on the theoretical underpinnings of computers as it does their actual uses and creation. Some common areas of study within the field include designing and applying computer software and hardware, along with theories concerning algorithms, information, and automation.</p>
        <h2 class="h2">The computer science industry applications</h2>
        <p class="p">There are countless ways that computer science is used in the professional world today. One of the most significant advances in computer science, for example, is artificial intelligence (AI), which leverages computing power to enable machines to perform complex tasks that traditionally only humans could perform. Already, AI is being used in a wide range of different industries, including automotive, retail, and health care. </p>
        <p class="p">That's not all, though. Here are some of the other ways that computer science technology is used in various industries across the world today:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The manufacturing industry develops and manufactures 3D printers for the medical community, dentistry, and architecture. Companies such as Nike and Ford Motor Company are among the top users of 3D technology.</li>
            <li>Robotics uses AI and other technologies to complete tasks that might otherwise be too dangerous for humans to perform. The medical field and automobile manufacturing industry both use robots. Along with the safety advantages, robotics can increase productivity.</li>
            <li>Computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) are the technologies that allow phones to recognize faces and digital assistants to understand commands. Self-driving cars, the health care field, and law enforcement currently use computer vision.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="h2">Computer science disciplines</h2>
